## Who Am I?  
Hi, I'm Arizha Praja Wirakusuma, an Information System Student at [Gunadarma University](www.gunadarma.ac.id). I'm a **CP Enthusiast** and a **CTF Enthusiast**. I thrive on challenges, logic puzzles, and tech adventures. My ultimate goal is to become a skilled **Fullstack Developer**, and I'm focusing on mastering **Ruby on Rails (RoR)** to build dynamic and efficient web applications.   

I'm deeply in love with *her*. She inspires and motivates me to keep growing every day. None of this would be possible without the endless support and love from my **parents**. Thank you!! Mom and Dad...
